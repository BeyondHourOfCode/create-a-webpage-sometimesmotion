# Create Your Own Webpage

Use the page template from https://jsbin.com/bukina/edit and either cut & paste the code into your own text editor or start your own page within JSBin (just start typing- it will automatically create a new page for you).

Add the following elements to your webpage:
* a first-level header `<h1>` with the title of your page
* a second-level header `<h2>` with your name
* a paragraph `<p>` with an introduction to your page
* a div element `<div>` that will contain all of the main content on your page

Now create some styles for your page:
* give your `<h1>` element a different color from your `<h2>` element
* indent your paragraph by giving it a 'padding-left' property
* give a background color to your `<div>` that will stand out from the `<body>`
 
##Get Creative!

Now go ahead and create more content- if you already have an idea for a site, start prototyping it out by creating divs that will create a layout for you. If you are still thinking of ideas, you can start to play around with creating a layout. Use text from a website like Wikipedia as placeholder text. Add some images, choose your font(s), create some background colors. 

Look at your favorite websites and try to emulate some of their design ideas. For example, if you like the way a search box looks, open the dev tools to copy and paste the HTML and then look at the styles and copy the CSS. 

Create whatever you like- if this is too open-ended for you, just copy a page that you like and try to try to create your own that looks the same. Or else, if there is a page you particularly *don't* like, copy it and create a better one!
